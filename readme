Business understanding:

This is a dataset got from Kaggle, it is about the us economic indicators since 1930 till 2019, 27 columns of data.
It is about GDP, detailed GDP, consumption, investment, government expenditures...

Data understanding:

It is an excel file that needed a lot of cleaning. A lot of null cells in it, unnamed columns, I had to transpose the table.
Problems that occured while working with this file, I could not work in Jupyter on the transposed table, I don't know why.
Cleaning was done on excel as it was a lot easier than on python.

Modeling:

The model consists of 5 parts:

First opening the libraries and the file.

Second a correlation between GDP and consumtion.

Third the mean of investment.

Fourth a time serie rolling mean  on GDP with its chart.

Last a visualization of the imports.

This project was my first one, I learned a lot from it and hopefully will continue to learn.
